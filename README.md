### Instructions

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

-   Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

-   Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

-   Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

#### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

1.  Read the `lending_data.csv` data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

2.  Create the labels set (`y`) from the "loan_status" column, and then create the features (`X`) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

    **NOTE**

    A value of 0 in the "loan_status" column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.

3.  Split the data into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.

#### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

1.  Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

2.  Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.

3.  Evaluate the model's performance by doing the following:

    -   Generate a confusion matrix.

    -   Print the classification report.

4.  Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

#### Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. You should write this report as the `README.md` file included in your GitHub repository.

Structure your report by using the report template that `Starter_Code.zip` includes, ensuring that it contains the following:

1.  **An overview of the analysis:** Explain the purpose of this analysis.

2.  **The results:** Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

3.  **A summary:** Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don't recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
